  ## TTB's Underpowered Characters

In this page, we're gonna be talking about underpowered characters in the game Teen Titans Battlegrounds. There are roughly 7 out of 21 normal characters that can be classified as **underpowered** or **off-meta** in which can still be considered as underperforming in the game and in this page, we'll talk about them.

### Speedy (Off-Meta)
For such an offensive marksman, how can he be off the meta? Well, there are commonly used characters that can counter him quite easily, Robin and Beast Boy, and oh boy they are everywhere. Makes sense Speedy can't hold on long in the battlefield when the most of his opponents are commonly used characters and are a direct counter to him.

### Aqualad (Underpowered)
Hold on, they were powerhouses before, what happened? Yeah, long story short, in an update, he got nerfed heavily. His burst combo isn't even enough to kill a Robin. What's worse is that he has no A.O.E (Area of Effect) skills to deal against a crowd of enemies. He already is one of the lowest mobility, and nerfing his death-defining burst combo is just a bad deal.

### Apprentice Robin (Off meta)
He's a solid character, but with the rise of fast moving characters as the meta... yeah his immobility and narrow attacks won't get him that close to the meta.

### Bumblebee (Undepowered)
Rule of thumb in the game where range is better than melee. She's basically the opposite of Starfire's capability of a primary range, secondary melee character. She's primary melee, secondary range. Her melee doesn't really give her any significant advantage over the opponent like Robin except for her attack speed. Her fly is just as fast as Starfire so basically, she's just a worse version of Starfire. Yikes.

### Raven (Underpowered)
Ah, as much as you people have flex your 30 bomb with this character, admit it you were fighting noobs. Raven's attacks can be too predictable. Since she heavily relies in predicting and timing, observant players can just counterpredict Raven's attacks. Not to mention she's a miss one miss all character. Miss an attack? You're gonna get punished immediately for that.

### Jinx (Underpowered/Off-Meta)
She's the worst melee fighter there is. Slow base speed, followed up with weak attacks that can't be consistent. Yeah, recipe for a underpowered/off-meta character.

### Gizmo (Underpowered/Off-Meta)
Alright, he's the top 1 worst character in the game. Very limited range for range attacks, other attacks that are just hard to hit the enemy. Worse? His missiles got nerfed later in an update. What were the devs thinking!? Guess they really want to make the worst character huh? Well there ya go.

### Overall
**Off-meta** characters can easily be fixed by changing the meta. The meta right now are fast and quick characters, glass canons. Can't the devs change the meta to slow and high damage characters? For **underpowered** characters, they need to be reworked/revamped or buffed. Characters like Raven and Aqualad needs buffing with their damage. While Gizmo, Jinx, and BumbleBee needs to get revamped or get reworked on their skills.ss
